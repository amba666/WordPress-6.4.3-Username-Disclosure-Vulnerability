### Description :  
the REST API allows simulating different request types. As such, we can  
perform a POST request with the “users” string in the body of the request,  
and tell the REST API to act like it’s received a GET request.  
You can see the management username in the "slug" feature. And even  
security plugins like "iThemes Security" do not block this path.
